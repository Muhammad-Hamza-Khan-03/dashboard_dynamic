User Request:\nhi\n    \n5. Markdown Formatting:\n- Use Markdown formatting in your responses.\n- Wrap SQL queries and results in triple backticks (```).\n- Use # for headers, ## for subheaders, etc.\n- Use * or - for bullet points.\n- Use **text** for bold and *text* for italics.\n- Format result tables using | for columns and - for separators.\n\nPlease follow the user\'s instructions to generate the appropriate graph or analysis. Ensure your code is efficient and can handle the full dataset. If the user\'s request is unclear or could be interpreted in multiple ways, ask for clarification.\n\nAfter executing the code, explain your approach and any insights gained from the visualization or analysis. Always show the number of rows using markdown table. If there are any limitations or potential issues with the requested visualization given the nature of the data, mention them.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'hi'}], 'model': 'llama3-groq-70b-8192-tool-use-preview', 'n': 1, 'stop': None, 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.7}}

User Request:\nyeah give me some interesting insights \n    \n5. Markdown Formatting:\n- Use Markdown formatting in your responses.\n- Wrap SQL queries and results in triple backticks (```).\n- Use # for headers, ## for subheaders, etc.\n- Use * or - for bullet points.\n- Use **text** for bold and *text* for italics.\n- Format result tables using | for columns and - for separators.\n\nPlease follow the user\'s instructions to generate the appropriate graph or analysis. Ensure your code is efficient and can handle the full dataset. If the user\'s request is unclear or could be interpreted in multiple ways, ask for clarification.\n\nAfter executing the code, explain your approach and any insights gained from the visualization or analysis. Always show the number of rows using markdown table.

Ensure your code is efficient and can handle the full dataset. If the user\'s request is unclear or could be interpreted in multiple ways, ask for clarification.\n\nAfter executing the code, explain your approach and any insights gained from the visualization or analysis.

User Request:\nmake a bar chart from it\n    \n5. Markdown Formatting:\n- Use Markdown formatting in your responses.\n- Wrap SQL queries and results in triple backticks (```).\n- Use # for headers, ## for subheaders, etc.\n- Use * or - for bullet points.\n- Use **text** for bold and *text* for italics.\n- Format result tables using | for columns and - for separators.\n\nPlease follow the user\'s instructions to generate the appropriate graph or analysis. Ensure your code is efficient and can handle the full dataset. If the user\'s request is unclear or could be interpreted in multiple ways, ask for clarification.\n\nAfter executing the code, explain your approach and any insights gained from the visualization or analysis. Always show the number of rows using markdown table.

Markdown Formatting:\n- Use Markdown formatting in your responses.\n- Wrap SQL queries and results in triple backticks (```).\n- Use # for headers, ## for subheaders, etc.\n- Use * or - for bullet points.\n- Use **text** for bold and *text* for italics.\n- Format result tables using | for columns and - for separators.\n\nPlease follow the user\'s instructions to generate the appropriate graph or analysis. Ensure your code is efficient and can handle the full dataset. If the user\'s request is unclear or could be interpreted in multiple ways, ask for clarification.\n\nAfter executing the code, explain your approach and any insights gained from the visualization or analysis. Always show the number of rows using markdown table.

Important Notes:\n- The full dataset is available in the `df` variable.\n- Use `df.dtypes` to check column data types if needed.\n- Handle potential missing values appropriately.\n- Consider the entire dataset when making visualizations or analyses.\n\n4. User Request:\nWhat is the average patient survey star rating across all hospitals?\n    \n5. Markdown Formatting:\n- Use Markdown formatting in your responses.\n- Wrap SQL queries and results in triple backticks (```).\n- Use # for headers, ## for subheaders, etc.\n- Use * or - for bullet points.\n- Use **text** for bold and *text* for italics.\n- Format result tables using | for columns and - for separators.\n\nPlease follow the user\'s instructions to generate the appropriate graph or analysis. Ensure your code is efficient and can handle the full dataset.

Markdown Formatting:\n- Use Markdown formatting in your responses.\n- Wrap SQL queries and results in triple backticks (```).\n- Use # for headers, ## for subheaders, etc.\n- Use * or - for bullet points.\n- Use **text** for bold and *text* for italics.\n- Format result tables using | for columns and - for separators.\n\nPlease follow the user\'s instructions to generate the appropriate graph or analysis. Ensure your code is efficient and can handle the full dataset. If the user\'s request is unclear or could be interpreted in multiple ways, ask for clarification.\n\nAfter executing the code, explain your approach and any insights gained from the visualization or analysis. Always show the number of rows using markdown table.

Ensure your code is efficient and can handle the full dataset. If the user\'s request is unclear or could be interpreted in multiple ways, ask for clarification.\n\nAfter executing the code, explain your approach and any insights gained from the visualization or analysis. Always show the number of rows using markdown table.

User Request:\nhe\n    \n5. Markdown Formatting:\n- Use Markdown formatting in your responses.\n- Wrap SQL queries and results in triple backticks (```).\n- Use # for headers, ## for subheaders, etc.\n- Use * or - for bullet points.\n- Use **text** for bold and *text* for italics.\n- Format result tables using | for columns and - for separators.\n\nPlease follow the user\'s instructions to generate the appropriate graph or analysis. Ensure your code is efficient and can handle the full dataset. If the user\'s request is unclear or could be interpreted in multiple ways, ask for clarification.\n\nAfter executing the code, explain your approach and any insights gained from the visualization or analysis. Always show the number of rows using markdown table.

2024-12-11 11:25:34,201 DEBUG Prompt sent to model: Analyze the user's input and the provided database schema. Verify if the necessary columns exist and then generate 3 insightful SQL-oriented follow-up questions that:
1. Dig deeper into the user's initial query
2. Explore related aspects of the data
3. Uncover potential trends or patterns

Ensure each question:
- Is directly executable as a SQL query
- Utilizes appropriate tables and columns from the schema
- Incorporates relevant SQL functions or operations
- Avoids redundancy with the original query

Format: Present only the questions, one per line, without numbering or explanation. Also show any row/s or table using the markdown table.

User input: tell me number of tables
